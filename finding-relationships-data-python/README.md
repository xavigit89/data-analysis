# Finding Relationships in Data with Python
Demos from the [Finding Relationships in Data with Python](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/finding-relationships-data-python) course in Pluralsight.

## Descriptive Statistics
### Univariate
#### Measures of Frequency
- Frequency tables: Category|Value ==> How often it appears in dataset.
- Histogram: Bins of continuous data ==> How many data points fall within bin.
#### Measures of Central Tendency
- Average (Mean)
- Median: datapoint at 50% percentile (one half of data "to the left", the other half "to the right")
- Mode: value that appears more often in the dataset.
- Others:
  - Geometic Mean
  - Harmonic Mean
#### Measures of Dispersion
- Range (max - min)
- Inter-quartile range (IQR): 75% percentile data point - 25% percentile data point
- Standard deviation and variance

### Bivariate
Relation between two variables
- Covariance: direction and strength of relation between two variables.
- Correlation:
  - Depends on covariance
  - Standardized: range [-1, 1]

### Multivariate
Relation between multiple variables.

- Covariance Matrix
- Correlation Matrix
